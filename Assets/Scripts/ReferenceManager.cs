// This script is designed to establish references for instantiated prefabs because you cannot 
// assign references to prefabs directly.

// in order to reference other gameobjects in prefabs (no linking possible), reference these gameobjects
// in this script which is always available in scene. When the prefab needing the reference
// becomes instantiated, the reference to the reference needed. In the Start function. Like this:
// GameObject camera;
// void Start(){
// 		camera = ReferenceManager.Instance.camera;
// }
